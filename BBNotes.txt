/////////// Trying to make scene.json importable

1 - edited tsconfig.json to include in the "include" field also the scene.json
followed typescript compiler options
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html
https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html

    as it originally was
        "include": ["src/**/*.ts"],
    modified by me to include scene.json
        "include": ["src/**/*.ts", "scene.json"],

//  I tried to add this to  the tsconfig.json > "compileroptions"
    but it didn't work
    "resolveJsonModule": true

// tried to add this to the top of game.ts but it didn't work
    import * as scene from  "scene.json"
    log("BB scene:", scene);
